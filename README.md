**This software has been moved and merged with the [`New Eden library`](https://markfelder.org/software/neweden) and is now considered obsolete.**

This is a simple vector library written in C.
It is a single header, single source project that builds to a static library.
The API can be found in [`src/acvector.h`](src/acvector.h).
A simple example can be found in [`example.c`](example.c). To build it run `make example` (or `make all`).
